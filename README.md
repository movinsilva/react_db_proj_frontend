Bank Transaction And Loan Processing System

The project involves designing a Core Banking Solution for a private bank in Seychelles, which has been using an outdated DOS system. The first phase of the project includes creating a database system to manage bank branches, internal fund transfers, loan processing, and various account types such as Savings, Checking, and Fixed Deposits. The system also involves setting up interest rates, loan approvals, online loan applications, and generating branch-wise transaction reports. The team must ensure data consistency, employ procedures, functions, and triggers for ACID properties, set up primary and foreign keys, and populate the database with dummy data.

In summary, the project aims to modernize the bank's operations by developing a comprehensive database system to handle banking operations, account management, loans, and reporting, complying with Seychelles' financial regulations.
